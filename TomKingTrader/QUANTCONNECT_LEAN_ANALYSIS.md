# QuantConnect LEAN vs Current Framework Analysis

## 🎯 MAJOR DISCOVERY: TastyTrade IS Fully Supported!

After thorough investigation, I've discovered that QuantConnect LEAN **DOES** support TastyTrade as both:
1. **Data Provider** - Free for funded TastyTrade accounts
2. **Live Brokerage** - Full trading execution support
3. **Paper Trading** - Via QuantConnect's paper trading with TastyTrade data

## ✅ QuantConnect LEAN Advantages for Tom King Framework

### 1. **Built-in TastyTrade Integration**
```python
# Simple TastyTrade setup in QuantConnect
self.SetBrokerageModel(BrokerageName.Tastytrade)

```

### 2. **Professional Backtesting**
- 20+ years of historical data
- Realistic fills with slippage/fees
- Options data with Greeks
- No need to build our own backtesting engine

### 3. **Pre-built Options Strategies**
```python
# Example: Tom King's strangle strategy
strangle = OptionStrategies.Strangle(
    self.symbol,
    strike_call,
    strike_put,
    expiry
)
self.Buy(strangle, quantity)
```

### 4. **Automatic Dashboard & Reporting**
- Real-time P&L charts

## 🚀 Tom King Strategy in QuantConnect

### Example: Friday 0DTE Strategy
```python
class TomKingFriday0DTE(QCAlgorithm):
    def Initialize(self):
        self.SetStartDate(2023, 1, 1)
        self.SetCash(35000)  # £35k starting capital
        self.SetBrokerageModel(BrokerageName.Tastytrade)
        
        # Add SPY options
        self.spy = self.AddEquity("SPY", Resolution.Minute)
        self.option = self.AddOption("SPY", Resolution.Minute)
        self.option.SetFilter(-5, 5, 0, 0)  # 0DTE only
        
        # Schedule for Friday 10:30 AM
        self.Schedule.On(
            self.DateRules.Every(DayOfWeek.Friday),
            self.TimeRules.At(10, 30),
            self.EnterFriday0DTE
        )
    
    def EnterFriday0DTE(self):
        if self.Portfolio.Invested:
            return
            
        # Get 0DTE options
        chain = self.CurrentSlice.OptionChains.get(self.option.Symbol)
        if not chain:
            return
            
        # Find ATM strikes
        underlying_price = self.Securities[self.spy.Symbol].Price
        calls = [x for x in chain if x.Right == OptionRight.Call]
        puts = [x for x in chain if x.Right == OptionRight.Put]
        
        # Tom King's 88% win rate setup
        atm_call = min(calls, key=lambda x: abs(x.Strike - underlying_price))
        atm_put = min(puts, key=lambda x: abs(x.Strike - underlying_price))
        
        # Sell iron condor
        self.Sell(atm_call.Symbol, 1)
        self.Sell(atm_put.Symbol, 1)
        
        # Set profit target at 50%
        self.StopMarketOrder(atm_call.Symbol, 1, atm_call.BidPrice * 0.5)
        self.StopMarketOrder(atm_put.Symbol, 1, atm_put.BidPrice * 0.5)
```
