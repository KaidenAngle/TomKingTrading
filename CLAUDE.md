This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview
Tom King Trading Framework v17 - Advanced automated trading system implementing Tom King's systematic trading methodology with comprehensive JavaScript pattern analysis engine, TastyTrade API integration, real-time HTML dashboard, and Section 9B advanced strategies. Designed to transform Â£35k into Â£80k within 8 months using proven options and futures strategies with strict risk management protocols.

## Project Goal: Â£35k to Â£80k in 8 Months
Transform Â£35,000 into Â£80,000 within 8 months using Tom King's systematic options and futures strategies, achieving financial freedom with Â£10,000 monthly income through 12% monthly compounding while maintaining 52-65% buying power usage and strict risk protocols. Using his Zero DTE Friday strategy (no losses in 2+ years), Long-Term 112 trades, and diversified futures strangles, we target aggressive but achievable 6.67% monthly returns while maintaining strict risk management (5% max per trade, 50% max buying power). The goal is complete financial independence by month 18, when the account reaches Â£100k and can sustainably generate Â£3,000 monthly at conservative 3% returns - enough to quit traditional employment and live off trading income alone.

## Claude Code Tool Usage Guidelines

### Agent Tool Usage
- Use Agent tool for complex searches when not confident about finding matches quickly
- Use for searching keywords like "config" or "logger" across the codebase
- NOT for specific file paths (use Read/Glob instead)
- NOT for specific class definitions (use Glob instead)
- Launch multiple agents concurrently when possible for performance

### File Operations
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) unless explicitly requested
- Use Read tool before editing to understand context
- Use MultiEdit for multiple changes to same file
- Always use absolute paths, not relative paths

### Git Commit Guidelines
When creating commits:
1. Run in parallel: git status, git diff, git log (to understand context)
2. Analyze changes and draft concise commit message focusing on "why" not "what"
3. Use HEREDOC format for commit messages:
```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
type: brief description

Detailed explanation if needed
- Bullet points for changes

ðŸ¤– Generated with Claude Code
Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```
4. NEVER update git config
5. NEVER push unless explicitly requested
6. Retry once if pre-commit hooks fail

### Search Best Practices
- Use Grep for content search (NOT bash grep/find)
- Use Glob for file pattern matching
- Use ripgrep (rg) if bash search needed
- Batch multiple searches together for performance
- Avoid cd command - use absolute paths instead

### Todo Management
Use TodoWrite for:
- Complex multi-step tasks (3+ steps)
- Non-trivial planning requirements
- Multiple user-provided tasks
- Tracking progress systematically

Don't use for:
- Single straightforward tasks
- Trivial operations
- Purely informational requests

### Important Reminders
- Maintain current directory with absolute paths
- Quote file paths with spaces properly
- Only one task in_progress at a time
- Mark tasks complete immediately after finishing
- Never mark partial work as completed
- Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
- NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files to creating new ones
