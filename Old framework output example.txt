Tom King Trading Dashboard - £40k AccountInteractive artifact Strategized trading framework for fresh £40,000 account deployment.13sI've completed the analysis according to the Tom King Framework v8.0 for a £40,000 account with no current positions. The analysis includes:

Complete position health dashboard (none since no positions)
Pattern analysis with available data
Tuesday execution plan (strangle entry day)
Sustainability check showing urgency with only 5 days left
BP allocation plan
Risk and concentration check
7-day calendar
HTML dashboard with all visualizations

Key points:

Account has 0% BP used, fresh start
Tuesday is strangle entry day
VIX at 16.5 (NORMAL regime) allows 60-70% BP
Qualified for micro futures and ETFs
TLT shows good setup with IV rank 54
Need more data for other tickers before specific recommendations
Only 5 days left in month, urgent deployment needed
Can deploy 2 strangles, prepare for Wednesday LT112, Friday 0DTE

The framework correctly enforces data-first rules by noting where searches are required before specific strike recommendations can be made.Your £40,000 account analysis is complete. With no current positions and 0% BP used, you're in an ideal position to deploy capital strategically.
Key Findings:
Today's Priority (Tuesday):

Strangle Entry Day - Deploy 2 positions maximum
TLT appears qualified with IV rank 54 (good for strangles)
MCL needs IV rank verification before entry
Target 5% total BP deployment today

Critical Timing Issue:
With only 5 days remaining in August and £0 P&L, you need £640 daily to reach your 8% monthly target (£3,200). Immediate deployment is essential.
This Week's Plan:

Today: 2 strangles (5% BP)
Wednesday: 2 MES LT112 positions (6% BP)
Friday: 2 ES 0DTE contracts (7% BP) + consider IPMCC (8% BP)
Total deployment: 26% of available 70%

Required Actions:

Search MCL IV rank to confirm strangle viability
Enter TLT strangle if comfortable with current setup
Prepare for tomorrow's LT112 entry (search MES 120 DTE chains)
Set Friday 10:30 AM alert for 0DTE execution

The dashboard shows your complete position deployment schedule, BP allocation plan, and qualified ticker analysis. Your VIX regime (NORMAL at 16.5) allows up to 70% BP usage, giving you plenty of room to deploy the core strategies effectively.
With disciplined execution this week, you can still achieve meaningful returns for August while setting up September for a full month of income generation.
