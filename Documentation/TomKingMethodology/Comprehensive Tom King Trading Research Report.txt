     Key Strategies Beyond Our Current PDF

     1. The 1-1-2 (Long-Term 112) Strategy - Enhanced Details

     - Structure: One OTM long put + one short put below + two short puts further OTM
     - Target Returns: 3% per month minimum (36% annualized)

     - Win Rate: 95% theoretical (shorts positioned at 5-delta)
     - Advantage: No upside risk, net credit trade
     - New Variant: Calendarized 1-1-2 (developed post-August 2024)
       - Put debit spread at 150 DTE
       - Two naked puts at 30 DTE
       - Better volatility risk management

     2. Strangle Strategy Specifics

     - Primary Focus: 90 DTE strangles on ES, CL, ZB futures
     - Efficiency: More capital efficient than 1-1-2 due to no hedges
     - Performance: Part of his $105k profit on $250k account strategy mix

     3. Strategy Hierarchy (His Three Favorites)

     1. Naked Puts: 30, 60, 90 DTE (even LEAPs on quality assets)
     2. Strangles: 90 DTE on futures
     3. 11x Bear Trap Trades: 60 DTE 112 trades, ATM 11x, calendarized 112

     Implementation Best Practices

     What Works

     1. Mechanical Execution: Consistent, repeatable approach
     2. Probability Focus: "It's all about probabilities"
     3. Community Support: Active Discord/chat rooms with real-time guidance
     4. Education Emphasis: Extensive teaching of WHY behind trades

     Common Mistakes

     1. Under-capitalization: Need significant capital for strategy diversification
     2. Ignoring Volatility Regimes: Mechanical approach without adaptation
     3. Over-leveraging: Exceeding position size limits
     4. Correlation Blindness: Not managing related positions

     Strategy Weaknesses Identified

     1. Volatility Regime Blindness

     - Strategies work well in low-medium volatility
     - Catastrophic failures during vol spikes (Aug 5, 2024)
     - Limited adaptation to changing market conditions

     2. Correlation Risk

     - Multiple short premium positions correlate heavily
     - No systematic correlation group management
     - August event showed massive correlation breakdown

     3. Capital Requirements

     - Strategies require substantial buying power
     - Small accounts can't properly diversify
     - Monthly fee ($149) high relative to small account returns

     Enhancements for Our Implementation

     1. VIX Regime Integration

     Our framework should implement the VIX-based position sizing that Tom King lacks:
     - VIX 0-20: Full position sizing
     - VIX 20-30: Reduce by 25%
     - VIX 30-40: Reduce by 50%
     - VIX 40+: Minimal/no new positions

     2. Correlation Group Management

     Implement strict limits that Tom King's approach overlooks:
     - Maximum 3 positions per correlation group
     - Real-time correlation monitoring
     - Automatic position rejection if limits exceeded

     3. Defensive Management

     - 21 DTE management (earlier than Tom King's approach)
     - 50% profit targets (more aggressive than his method)
     - Dynamic adjustment based on volatility environment

     4. Capital Efficiency

     - Phase-based approach (£30k-£80k progression)
     - UK pound sterling calculations
     - Buying power optimization

     Missing Elements in Current Implementation

     1. Strategy Variations

     - Calendarized 1-1-2 structure
     - 11x Bear Trap methodology
     - LEAPs integration for Phase 3+

     2. Community Elements

     - Real-time chat integration
     - Trade sharing and discussion
     - Educational progression system

     3. Performance Tracking

     - Monthly return targets (3%+)
     - Win rate monitoring (95% target)
     - Risk metric dashboards

     This research reveals that while Tom King has developed profitable strategies, the August 2024 event exposed critical weaknesses in volatility adaptation and correlation management that our framework must address to      
     achieve the £35k to £80k goal safely.
