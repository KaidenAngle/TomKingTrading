# Tom King System - Backtest Analysis & Critical Gaps

## Executive Summary
**The backtest results show MASSIVE implementation gaps. The system is NOT trading according to Tom King methodology.**

## What's Actually Happening vs What Should Happen

### 1. OPTIONS TRADING - COMPLETELY MISSING ❌
**Expected:** Iron condors, put spreads, calendar spreads with options
**Reality:** Only buying/selling stocks (SPY, QQQ, IWM)
**Impact:** Missing 95% of the strategy's edge

The Tom King system is ENTIRELY based on options strategies:
- Friday 0DTE Iron Condors (88% win rate)
- 1-1-2 Put Spreads (75% win rate)
- ITM Put Calendars (70% win rate)
- LEAP Put Ladders
- Futures Strangles

**Current Implementation: ZERO options trades**

### 2. FRIDAY 0DTE STRATEGY - NOT EXECUTING ❌
**Expected:** Every Friday at 10:30 AM, place iron condors
**Reality:** No Friday-specific trades visible
**Evidence:** Orders show monthly entries, not weekly Friday entries

### 3. POSITION FREQUENCY - WAY TOO LOW ❌
**Expected:** 
- Weekly positions (52+ trades/year minimum)
- Multiple concurrent positions
- 3-5 strategies running simultaneously

**Reality:** 
- Only 49 total orders in entire year
- Only 2 symbols traded at once
- Positions held for exactly 21 days then closed

### 4. VIX FILTERING - NOT WORKING ❌
**Expected:** Only trade when VIX > 22
**Reality:** System entering positions regardless of VIX
**Note:** The code checks VIX but using DAILY resolution instead of intraday

### 5. PROFIT TARGETS - NOT BEING HIT ❌
**Expected:** 
- 50% profit target closes
- 200% stop loss for 0DTE

**Reality:** 
- All positions closed at exactly 21 days (DTE_MANAGEMENT)
- No profit target closures visible
- No stop loss executions

## Trade Analysis

### Actual Trades Made:
1. **Feb 1:** Buy QQQ (17 shares) + IWM (38 shares)
2. **Feb 23:** Sell both (21 days later) - FLAT LIQUIDATION
3. **Mar 1:** Buy QQQ + IWM again
4. **Mar 22:** Sell both (21 days) - FLAT LIQUIDATION
5. **Pattern continues all year...**

### Problems with These Trades:
- **No options** - Just stock buys
- **Fixed 21-day holding** - Mechanical, not strategic
- **No Friday entries** - Missing main strategy
- **No profit management** - Just time-based exits

## Why Returns Are So Low

### Tom King Target: £35k → £80k (128% return in 8 months)
### Actual Result: ~0% return (just churning positions)

**Reasons:**
1. **Wrong instruments** - Stocks instead of options
2. **Wrong timing** - Monthly instead of weekly
3. **Wrong management** - Time-based instead of profit-based
4. **Missing leverage** - Options provide 10-20x leverage
5. **Missing theta decay** - Core of the strategy
6. **Missing volatility premium** - Main source of profits

## Critical Code Issues

### 1. Resolution Problem
```python
self.vix = self.AddIndex("VIX", Resolution.Daily)  # WRONG!
# Should be: Resolution.Minute
```

### 2. Options Never Added
```python
# Code has AddOption() calls but they're not being used
# The actual trades are using SetHoldings() on stocks
```

### 3. Friday Strategy Check Fails
```python
if self.current_vix < 22:
    return  # This blocks most trades
```

### 4. Position Sizing Too Conservative
```python
return max(0.10, min(kelly, 0.30))  # Max 30% per position
# Should allow up to 80% total when VIX > 40
```

## What Needs to be Fixed IMMEDIATELY

### Priority 1: Enable Options Trading
- Change to minute/tick resolution
- Implement actual option order placement
- Use Combo orders for spreads

### Priority 2: Fix Friday 0DTE
- Check day of week properly
- Enter at 10:30 AM specifically
- Use 0DTE option chains

### Priority 3: Fix Position Management
- Implement 50% profit targets
- Add proper stop losses
- Remove fixed 21-day exit

### Priority 4: Increase Trade Frequency
- Should have 200+ trades per year minimum
- Multiple strategies running concurrently
- Proper correlation management

### Priority 5: Fix VIX Integration
- Use intraday VIX data
- Proper regime detection
- Dynamic position sizing

## Expected vs Actual Metrics

| Metric | Tom King Expected | Actual Backtest |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| Annual Return | 100-150% | ~0% |
| Win Rate | 88% (Friday) | N/A (no real trades) |
| Trades/Year | 200+ | 49 |
| Options Used | 100% | 0% |
| Avg Hold Time | 1-45 days | Exactly 21 days |
| Profit Target Hits | 70%+ | 0% |
| Strategy Types | 5+ | 1 (stock only) |

## Conclusion

**The system is fundamentally broken.** It's not implementing ANY of the Tom King options strategies. Instead, it's just buying and selling stocks on a fixed schedule. This is why returns are near zero.

**To achieve Tom King's targets, we MUST:**
1. Implement real options trading
2. Execute Friday 0DTE strategy
3. Add all 5 core strategies
4. Fix position management
5. Increase trade frequency 10x

**Current Implementation Score: 5/100**
**It's not a Tom King system - it's just a stock rotation timer.**
