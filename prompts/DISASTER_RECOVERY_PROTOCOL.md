## Execution Instructions

**Systematic Disaster Testing:**
1. **Create controlled test environment** that can simulate failures safely
2. **Execute each disaster scenario** in isolation to understand individual impacts
3. **Test combined failure scenarios** to validate handling of multiple simultaneous issues
4. **Measure recovery times and accuracy** for all disaster and recovery procedures
5. **Validate financial impact limits** for each type of crisis
6. **Document all procedures** and automate recovery where possible

**If Recovery Failures Found:**
- **Stop immediately** and document the specific failure scenario and impact
- **Analyze root cause** - System design flaw, insufficient error handling, missing procedures
- **Design improved recovery procedures** with specific implementation steps
- **Implement and test fixes** - Validate improvements work under crisis conditions
- **Continue testing** only when recovery procedures meet all success criteria

**Documentation Requirements:**
For each disaster scenario tested:
- **Failure simulation method**: How the disaster was simulated
- **System behavior observed**: Exact system response to the failure
- **Recovery procedure executed**: Steps taken to restore operation
- **Recovery time measured**: Actual time from failure to full restoration
- **Data integrity verification**: Confirmation of position and data accuracy
- **Financial impact assessment**: Any costs or losses resulting from the failure
- **Lessons learned**: Improvements needed for better disaster handling

**Crisis preparedness is essential for live trading with real money. Every failure mode must have a tested recovery procedure.**
