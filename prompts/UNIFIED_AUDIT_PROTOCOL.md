# Tom King Trading System - Autonomous Discovery & Implementation Protocol

## Mission: Complete System Discovery, Analysis & Implementation

Execute comprehensive autonomous analysis of the Tom King Trading System. Discover how it currently works, research the documented methodology, identify all gaps and issues, then implement complete solutions.

## Core Approach: Research-Driven Autonomous Analysis

**Your Research Foundation:**
- **Analyze the Tom King PDF documentation** completely to understand the intended methodology
- **Map the current algorithm implementation** to discover how it actually works
- **Cross-reference implementation against documentation** to identify gaps
- **Research optimal API integration strategies** through available documentation
- **Determine best validation approaches** based on your analysis

## PHASE 1: Discovery & Documentation Analysis

**Comprehensive Documentation Research:**
- **Study the Tom King PDF thoroughly** - Extract all trading rules, parameters, risk management protocols
- **Understand the complete methodology** - Account phases, strategy progression, position sizing rules
- **Document risk management principles** - Identify all limit types, correlation rules, VIX dependencies
- **Map strategy specifications** - Entry conditions, exit rules, profit targets, position management
- **Extract all mathematical formulas** - Position sizing, Greeks requirements, strike selection algorithms

**Current Algorithm Analysis:**
- **Trace complete algorithm flow** from initialization through trade execution
- **Map all components and their interactions** - Strategies, risk managers, data feeds, order systems
- **Document current implementations** - What's working, what's placeholder, what's incomplete
- **Identify data flow patterns** - How information moves through the system
- **Understand current API integrations** - What's implemented, what's missing

## PHASE 2: Gap Analysis & Issue Discovery

**Methodology Compliance Assessment:**
- **Compare current implementation against documented methodology** - Find all deviations and gaps
- **Validate strategy implementations** - Do they match the documented specifications?
- **Check risk management enforcement** - Are all documented limits actually enforced?
- **Verify account phase logic** - Does progression work as documented?
- **Assess position sizing accuracy** - Does it follow documented formulas?

**Technical Implementation Audit:**
- **Identify all placeholder implementations** - Functions returning dummy values, incomplete logic
- **Find integration gaps** - Where APIs aren't properly connected or implemented
- **Discover redundancies and inefficiencies** - Duplicate code, unnecessary complexity
- **Locate potential failure points** - Edge cases, error handling gaps, missing validations
- **Assess data accuracy** - Are calculations, pricing, and Greeks implementations correct?

## PHASE 3: API Integration Strategy Research

**API Capabilities Research:**
- **Analyze TastyWorks API documentation** - Understand all available endpoints, data types, limitations
- **Research QuantConnect capabilities** - Evaluate features, strengths, integration possibilities
- **Determine optimal integration approach** - Which API for which functions based on capabilities
- **Design fallback strategies** - How to handle API failures, rate limits, data gaps
- **Plan hybrid implementation** - Leverage strengths of each platform optimally

**Integration Point Mapping:**
- **Map each system function to optimal API** based on research findings
- **Identify critical integration points** - Order execution, data feeds, position tracking
- **Determine implementation priorities** - Which integrations are most critical
- **Plan testing approaches** - How to validate each integration works correctly

## PHASE 4: Systematic Implementation & Cleanup

**Implementation Protocol:**
- **Fix every identified gap immediately** with complete working implementations
- **Replace all placeholders** with production-ready code
- **Eliminate redundancies** through proper code organization and abstraction
- **Implement proper error handling** for all identified failure points
- **Validate each fix** before moving to the next issue

**Code Quality Enhancement:**
- **Remove all development artifacts** - IDE markers, version control remnants, placeholder comments
- **Organize code structure** logically and efficiently
- **Standardize naming and conventions** throughout the codebase
- **Eliminate dead code** and unused components
- **Optimize performance** where beneficial

## PHASE 5: Validation & Testing

**Methodology Compliance Testing:**
- **Verify strategy behavior** matches documented specifications
- **Test risk management systems** ensure all limits are properly enforced
- **Validate account phase transitions** work as intended
- **Confirm position sizing** follows documented formulas
- **Test edge cases and failure scenarios** based on your analysis

**Performance Validation:**
- **Assess trading frequency** and pattern generation
- **Validate return calculations** and profit targeting
- **Test risk controls** under various market conditions
- **Verify data accuracy** throughout the system
- **Confirm system stability** and reliability

## PHASE 6: Iterative Refinement

**Continuous Improvement Loop:**
- **Re-analyze the system** after each set of improvements
- **Discover new optimization opportunities** through deeper understanding
- **Implement enhanced features** that improve methodology compliance
- **Refine integration strategies** based on testing results
- **Continue until no further improvements identified**

## Implementation Standards

**For Every Issue Discovered:**
```
DISCOVERY: [What you found through analysis]
SOURCE: [PDF reference or code location where discovered]
ANALYSIS: [Why this is an issue based on your research]
SOLUTION: [Complete implementation to resolve]
VALIDATION: [How you verified the solution works]
```

**Research Documentation:**
- **Document your methodology understanding** from PDF analysis
- **Explain your API integration decisions** with supporting rationale
- **Record your implementation approach** for each major component
- **Note any assumptions or interpretations** you made during analysis

## Execution Instructions

**Begin autonomous research and implementation:**

1. **Study all documentation thoroughly** to understand intended system behavior
2. **Analyze current implementation completely** to understand actual system behavior  
3. **Identify gaps through systematic comparison** of intended vs actual
