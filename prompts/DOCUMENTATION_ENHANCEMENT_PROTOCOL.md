Documentation Enhancement and Knowledge Capture Session

  Please perform a systematic review and enhancement of the Tom King Trading Framework documentation. Follow this structured approach:

  Phase 1: Session Work Assessment
  - Analyze all work completed in recent sessions (check conversation history, git commits, file modifications)
  - Identify any significant architectural decisions, performance optimizations, bug fixes, or integration patterns
  - Look for new methodologies, systematic approaches, or lessons learned that aren't documented

  Phase 2: Documentation Gap Analysis
  - Read through the existing Documentation folder structure (D:\OneDrive\Trading\Claude\Documentation\)
  - Compare recent work against existing documentation to identify gaps
  - Check for redundancies - don't create duplicate documentation
  - Assess whether new work provides value for future development sessions

  Phase 3: Documentation Enhancement
  If valuable work is found that isn't documented:

  Create New Documentation:
  - Follow existing patterns in Documentation/Architecture/ for technical patterns
  - Follow existing patterns in Documentation/Methodology/ for trading rules
  - Use the same structure and style as existing docs (like QUANTCONNECT_API_PATTERNS.md)
  - Include specific code examples, "WRONG vs CORRECT" patterns, and clear rationales

  Update Existing Documentation:
  - Add new patterns to existing docs where they fit naturally
  - Update CRITICAL_DO_NOT_CHANGE.md if any new critical rules were discovered
  - Enhance QUANTCONNECT_API_PATTERNS.md with any new API compatibility issues
  - Update the main Documentation/README.md index to reflect changes

  Phase 4: Integration Verification
  - Ensure all new documentation is properly indexed in the main README
  - Update folder structure counts (e.g., "Architecture/ (12 docs)" â†’ "Architecture/ (13 docs)")
  - Add navigation links and quick reference updates
  - Verify no broken documentation links

  Focus Areas to Examine:
  1. Performance Optimizations - Caching strategies, API call reduction, conditional logic
  2. Integration Patterns - Component coordination, systematic verification methods
  3. Error Handling - New patterns for robust error management
  4. QuantConnect Compatibility - API changes, interface fixes, version compatibility
  5. Risk Management - New safety patterns, circuit breakers, limit enforcement
  6. Testing Methodologies - Systematic approaches, verification frameworks
  7. Production Lessons - Real trading insights, failure prevention patterns

  Quality Standards:
  - Include specific code examples with explanations
  - Explain the "why" behind each pattern, not just the "how"
  - Reference historical events/disasters that validate the patterns (like August 5, 2024)
  - Use production-ready examples, not theoretical code
  - Maintain consistency with existing documentation style

  Questions to Ask:
  - "Is this knowledge valuable for future development sessions?"
  - "Would documenting this prevent repeating the same analysis work?"
  - "Does this represent a systematic approach or methodology worth preserving?"
  - "Are there new architectural patterns that other systems could benefit from?"
  - "Did we solve compatibility issues that future developers will encounter?"

  Success Criteria:
  - All significant session work is either documented or explicitly deemed not worth documenting
  - No redundant documentation created
  - Existing documentation enhanced where appropriate
  - Documentation index fully updated
  - Clear value proposition for each new document created

  Please use TodoWrite to track your progress through each phase and provide a final summary of what was documented and why it adds value for future sessions.
