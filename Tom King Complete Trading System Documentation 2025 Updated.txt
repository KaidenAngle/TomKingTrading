Recovery Analysis:
The significant underperformance in months 4-6 was caused by conservative 
position sizing during market uncertainty. The system prioritized capital 
preservation over aggressive growth, successfully avoiding the August 2024 
correlation disaster that cost Tom King £308,000. 

Current trajectory suggests goal achievement by December 2024 (4-month delay) 
with much stronger risk management than originally planned.
