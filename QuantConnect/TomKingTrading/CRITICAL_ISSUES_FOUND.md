- **23 multi-leg strategy management issues**
- **16+ general logic and edge case issues**
- Multiple scenarios that could cause significant financial losses
- Several system crash vulnerabilities

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix Immediately)

### 1. Division by Zero Vulnerabilities

**File:** `risk/position_sizing.py`
**Issue:** Kelly fraction calculation can divide by zero
```python
# Line 112-113: DANGEROUS
kelly_fraction = numerator / denominator  # denominator could be 0!
```
**Impact:** System crash during position sizing
**Fix Required:** Add zero check before division

### 2. Time Zone Handling Failures

**File:** `strategies/friday_zero_day_options.py`
**Issue:** Mixing local time with market time
```python
# Line 71: Using self.Time without timezone conversion
if self.Time.hour == 10 and self.Time.minute == 30:  # Could be wrong timezone!
```
**Impact:** Strategies executing at wrong times (potentially 3 hours off)

### 3. Race Condition in Multi-Leg Execution

**File:** `strategies/strategy_order_executor.py`
**Issue:** No atomic execution for multi-leg orders
```python
# Lines 186-189: Non-atomic execution
for leg in trade_plan['legs']:
    ticket = self.place_order(leg)  # If one fails, others orphaned!
```
**Impact:** Partial fills creating unhedged positions

### 4. Stale Data Trading Risk

**File:** `main.py`
**Issue:** No validation of data freshness
```python
# Line 532: Using data without checking age
current_price = self.Securities[symbol].Price  # Could be hours old!
```
**Impact:** Trading on outdated prices

### 5. Assignment Risk Not Handled

**File:** Multiple strategy files
**Issue:** No early assignment detection or handling
**Impact:** Unexpected position changes, margin calls

---

## 🟡 HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES

### 6. Memory Leaks from Data Accumulation

**File:** `greeks/greeks_monitor.py`
**Issue:** Unbounded history lists
```python
self.greeks_history.append(snapshot)  # Never cleaned up!
```
**Impact:** Performance degradation over time

### 7. VIX Spike Cascade Failure

**File:** `risk/vix_regime.py`
**Issue:** No gradual position reduction during VIX spikes
**Impact:** Sudden position liquidation at worst prices

### 8. Correlation Group Race Conditions

**File:** `risk/august_2024_correlation_limiter.py`
**Issue:** Multiple strategies can exceed limits simultaneously
**Impact:** Correlation limits breached during volatile markets

### 9. Phase Transition Edge Cases

**File:** `main.py`
**Issue:** Account exactly at phase boundary causes oscillation
```python
if balance >= 50800:  # What if balance is exactly 50800?
    return 2
```

### 10. Order Rejection Not Handled

**File:** `helpers/option_order_executor.py`
**Issue:** No retry logic for rejected orders
**Impact:** Strategy thinks position is open when it's not

---

## 🔵 MULTI-LEG SPECIFIC ISSUES

### 11. IPMCC LEAP Expiration Not Managed

**File:** `strategies/in_perpetuity_covered_calls.py`
**Issue:** No logic to roll LEAP before expiration
**Impact:** Strategy fails when LEAP expires

### 12. LT112 Component Tracking Incomplete

**File:** `strategies/long_term_112_put_selling.py`
**Issue:** Can't track 1-1-2 structure components individually
**Impact:** Can't partially manage position

### 13. Iron Condor Wing Protection Missing

**File:** `strategies/friday_zero_day_options.py`
**Issue:** No logic to protect tested side
**Impact:** Max loss on tested side

### 14. Futures Contract Rolling Missing

**File:** `strategies/futures_strangle.py`
**Issue:** No automatic roll before expiration
**Impact:** Physical delivery risk

### 15. LEAP Ladder Rung Management

**File:** `strategies/leap_put_ladders.py`
**Issue:** Individual rungs not tracked
**Impact:** Can't optimize ladder adjustments

---

## 🟠 EDGE CASES & SUBTLE BUGS

### 16. Greeks Calculation with Zero IV

**File:** `greeks/greeks_monitor.py`
```python
iv = self.get_implied_volatility()  # Returns 0 if not found
vega = S * norm.pdf(d1) * sqrt(T)  # Wrong if IV is 0!
```

### 17. Negative Time to Expiration

**File:** Multiple files
**Issue:** DTE calculation can go negative near expiration
**Impact:** Math domain errors in Greeks calculations

### 18. Weekend Position Count

**File:** `main.py`
**Issue:** Position limits not adjusted for weekend holding
**Impact:** Excessive risk over weekends

### 19. Partial Fill P&L Calculation

**File:** `position_state_manager_qc.py`
**Issue:** P&L incorrect for partially filled orders
**Impact:** Incorrect performance reporting

### 20. Commission Impact on Small Positions

**File:** `risk/position_sizing.py`
**Issue:** Commission can exceed profit target on small positions
**Impact:** Guaranteed losses on small trades

---

## 📊 SYSTEM-WIDE ISSUES

### 21. No Circuit Breaker Coordination

Multiple strategies can trigger circuit breakers simultaneously, causing cascade

### 22. Portfolio Greeks Double Counting

Multi-leg positions counted multiple times in portfolio Greeks

### 23. Missing Halt/Suspension Handling

No logic for handling halted symbols

### 24. After-Hours Data Corruption

After-hours quotes can corrupt next day's calculations

### 25. Margin Requirement Changes

No handling for intraday margin requirement changes

## Conclusion

While the Tom King Trading System has good strategic logic and risk management concepts, the implementation has significant gaps that make it **unsafe for production trading**. These issues are fixable but require substantial additional development and testing before the system can be considered production-ready.

**Current True Readiness: ~65%** (not the 100% previously reported)

The overlooked issues discovered in this deep analysis represent real risks that could cause significant financial losses if deployed to live trading in the current state.
