# Tom King Trading Framework - Critical Fixes Applied
## Date: 2025-01-05

### Framework Validation Protocol Execution Complete

## FIXES APPLIED:

### 1. Missing lt112_strategy.py ✅
- Created complete LT112 strategy implementation
- 95% win rate target, 120 DTE entry, 21 DTE exit
- Implements 1-1-2 put spread structure

### 2. Import Corrections ✅
- Fixed TomKingFriday0DTEStrategy class name
- Updated imports in main.py to match actual files
- Added datetime imports where missing

### 3. Tom King Specifications ✅
- Friday 0DTE profit target: 25% (was 50%)
- LT112 DTE: 120 days (was 45)
- VIX emergency threshold: 35 (standardized)

### 4. Option Chain Configuration ✅
- Expanded strike range: -50 to +50
- Extended DTE range: 0 to 180 days
- Added warmup period: 30 days

### 5. Error Handling ✅
- Added try-catch to OnData method
- Added error handling to all strategy Execute methods
- Changed ComboMarketOrder to asynchronous

### 6. Validation Improvements ✅
- Added null checks for option chains
- Added IV validation with fallback
- Added error handling for order placement

### 7. Memory Management ✅
- Implemented rolling window for fill history
- Limited to 1000 fills per order
- Prevents unbounded memory growth

### 8. Execution Flow ✅
- ExecutionEngine already initialized (line 116)
- Fixed strategy execution methods
- Added proper error propagation

## COMPILATION STATUS:
✅ BUILD SUCCESS - No compilation errors

## BACKTEST STATUS:
⚠️ Runtime error in IPMCC strategy (line 650 reference is stale)
- Error appears to be from old code version
- Current code doesn't have self.Buy(leap_call, contracts) on line 650

## REMAINING ISSUES:

### High Priority:
1. IPMCC strategy execution error (needs investigation)
2. Option universe selection needs refinement
3. Greeks validation still needs improvement

### Medium Priority:
1. Scheduling conflicts potential
2. Correlation data flow verification
3. Performance monitoring setup

### Low Priority:
1. Magic number documentation
2. Calculation caching
3. Logging enhancement

## NEXT STEPS:
1. Investigate IPMCC runtime error
2. Run paper trading simulation
3. Monitor strategy execution
4. Validate risk controls

## RISK ASSESSMENT:
- Framework: IMPROVED
- Compilation: WORKING
- Runtime: NEEDS TESTING
- Production Ready: NO
