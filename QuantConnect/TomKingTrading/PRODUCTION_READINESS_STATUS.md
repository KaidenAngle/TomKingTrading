## **CRITICAL ITEMS STILL MISSING** ⚠️

### **Must Have Before Live Trading**
1. **Holiday Calendar Integration** - Partially exists, needs full integration
2. **Position State Persistence** - Save/restore positions after restart
3. **Broker Connection Monitoring** - Detect disconnections
4. **Commission/Fee Model** - Apply TastyTrade fees

### **Should Have Soon**
5. **Performance Tracking** - Compare actual vs expected win rates
6. **Futures Roll Management** - Auto-roll before expiry
7. **Max Positions Per Strategy** - Hard limits enforcement

---

## **SIMPLE INTEGRATION EXAMPLE**

```python
# In Initialize()
self.safety = SimpleSafetyChecks(self)
self.fill_check = SimpleOrderFillCheck(self)
self.assignment_check = SimpleAssignmentCheck(self)

# Before any trade
if not self.safety.check_before_trade():
    return  # Stop if unsafe

# Check assignment risk daily
self.assignment_check.close_risky_positions()

# Place iron condor with validation
orders = [...]  # Your 4 legs
if self.fill_check.place_iron_condor(orders):
    self.Log("✅ Iron condor filled")
else:
    self.Log("❌ Fill failed - positions cleaned up")
```
