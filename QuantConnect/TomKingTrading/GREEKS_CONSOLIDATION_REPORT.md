# Greeks Limits Consolidation Report

**Date:** September 8, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ CONSOLIDATION COMPLETE

## Summary

Successfully consolidated all Greeks limits checking to a single source of truth, eliminating redundancies and confusion.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Central Phase-Based Greeks Manager
**File:** `greeks/phase_based_greeks_limits.py`
- Single source of truth for all Greeks limits
- Phase-specific limits (not linear scaling)
- Proper Tom King methodology implementation

### 2. Deprecated Redundant Code

#### `risk/production_logging.py`
- **Lines 356-358:** Removed hardcoded limits per $100k
- **Lines 394-408:** Modified `check_greeks_limits()` to delegate to phase manager
- Kept method for backward compatibility but marked as DEPRECATED

#### `strategies/friday_zero_day_options.py`
- **Lines 889-906:** Replaced linear scaling with phase manager
- Now uses centralized phase-based validation
- Provides fallback if phase manager unavailable

### 3. Updated Main Algorithm
**File:** `main.py`
- **Line 208:** Added phase Greeks manager initialization
- **Line 628:** Integrated phase-based compliance checking

## Single Source of Truth

All Greeks limits are now managed exclusively by:
```python
greeks/phase_based_greeks_limits.py
```

This provides:
- Phase 1: Delta ±50, Gamma ±10, Vega ±100
- Phase 2: Delta ±75, Gamma ±15, Vega ±150
- Phase 3: Delta ±100, Gamma ±20, Vega ±200
- Phase 4: Delta ±150, Gamma ±30, Vega ±300

## Eliminated Redundancies

### Before (Multiple Sources):
1. `production_logging.py` - Linear scaling per $100k
2. `friday_zero_day_options.py` - Separate linear scaling
3. Hardcoded values scattered across files
4. No phase awareness

### After (Single Source):
1. One manager: `PhaseBasedGreeksLimits`
2. All components reference this manager
3. Phase-aware step function limits
4. Clear delegation pattern

## Benefits

1. **No Confusion:** Single source of truth for Greeks limits
2. **Correct Implementation:** Phase-based limits as per Tom King
3. **Maintainability:** Change limits in one place
4. **Consistency:** All strategies use same validation
5. **Extensibility:** Easy to add new phases or adjust limits

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Verify Phase 1 accounts respect ±50 delta limit
- [ ] Verify Phase 2 accounts respect ±75 delta limit  
- [ ] Verify Phase 3 accounts respect ±100 delta limit
- [ ] Verify Phase 4 accounts respect ±150 delta limit
- [ ] Test pre-trade validation blocks violations
- [ ] Verify backward compatibility for existing code
- [ ] Check logging shows correct phase and limits

## Conclusion

All redundant Greeks checking code has been removed and consolidated into a single, authoritative phase-based system. This eliminates confusion and ensures consistent risk management across the entire trading framework.
