# FINAL AUDIT CHECKLIST - Tom King Trading Framework

## CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix Immediately)
- [ ] **Syntax Errors** - Any Python syntax errors that prevent compilation
- [ ] **Import Failures** - Missing imports or circular import dependencies  
- [ ] **Type Errors** - Incorrect type annotations causing runtime failures
- [ ] **Unhandled Exceptions** - Exception scenarios that could crash the algorithm
- [ ] **Data Dependency Failures** - Critical failures when market data unavailable
- [ ] **Order Execution Failures** - Critical failures in order submission/management
- [ ] **Memory Leaks** - Unbounded data structures that grow infinitely
- [ ] **Race Conditions** - Threading issues that could cause inconsistent state

## HIGH ISSUES (Fix Before Production)
- [ ] **Logical Errors** - Incorrect business logic implementation
- [ ] **Configuration Errors** - Missing or invalid configuration parameters
- [ ] **Performance Issues** - Slow operations that could timeout
- [ ] **Resource Management** - Improper file/connection handling
- [ ] **Security Issues** - Hardcoded secrets or insecure operations
- [ ] **Data Validation** - Missing validation of critical inputs
- [ ] **Edge Case Handling** - Unhandled edge cases in calculations
- [ ] **Portfolio Management** - Incorrect position sizing or risk calculations

## MEDIUM ISSUES (Fix For Reliability)
- [ ] **Error Handling** - Missing try/catch blocks around risky operations
- [ ] **Logging Issues** - Missing or excessive logging that affects performance
- [ ] **Code Complexity** - Overly complex functions that are error-prone
- [ ] **Dead Code** - Unused functions or variables that add confusion
- [ ] **Documentation Issues** - Missing docstrings for critical functions
- [ ] **Inconsistent Patterns** - Inconsistent coding patterns across modules
- [ ] **Hardcoded Values** - Magic numbers that should be configurable
- [ ] **Test Coverage** - Missing tests for critical functionality

## LOW ISSUES (Fix For Maintainability)
- [ ] **Code Style** - Minor PEP8 violations or formatting issues
- [ ] **Variable Naming** - Unclear or inconsistent variable names
- [ ] **Comment Quality** - Outdated or misleading comments
- [ ] **Function Length** - Functions that are too long and should be split
- [ ] **Class Design** - Classes that violate single responsibility principle
- [ ] **Import Organization** - Disorganized or redundant imports
- [ ] **File Organization** - Files that don't belong in their current location
- [ ] **Minor Optimizations** - Small performance improvements

## AUDIT METHODOLOGY
1. **Pass 1: Static Analysis** - Check for syntax, imports, types, obvious errors
2. **Pass 2: Logic Review** - Review business logic and calculations for correctness
3. **Pass 3: Error Handling** - Ensure all risky operations have proper error handling
4. **Pass 4: Performance Review** - Check for performance bottlenecks and resource issues
5. **Pass 5: Security Review** - Check for security vulnerabilities and data exposure
6. **Pass 6: Final Validation** - Run final compilation and import tests

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- **Zero CRITICAL issues remaining**
- **Zero HIGH issues remaining** 
- **All files compile successfully**
- **All core modules import successfully**
- **No runtime exceptions during initialization**
- **Clean git commit ready for deployment**
