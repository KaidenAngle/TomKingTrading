TOM KING TRADING SYSTEM - AUTOMATED FRAMEWORK REFERENCE 
KEY TOM KING QUOTES & PRINCIPLES 
On Money Management 
•
 "I don't care about percentages, I care about dollars. I want to make money." 

•
 "3% monthly is my goal after 40 years of trading. If you can make 3% monthly consistently, you're beating 99% of hedge funds." 

•
 "Trade small, trade often - but with strict rules" 


On Experience & Losses 
•
 "Experience is the best teacher. I've blown up accounts 6 times before 2008." 

•
 "The 112 wasn't the problem - I had 6 positions on. Overleveraging was the problem." 

•
 "Each time you blow up, you learn what not to do. The last time was 2008." 


On Strategy 
•
 "I only trade ES/SPX for zero DTE. It's liquid, predictable, and I've not lost in 2 years." 

•
 "I hate stocks. I only trade the biggest names that can't go to zero overnight." 

•
 "Rolling is closing a loser and opening a riskier trade. Just take the loss." 


On Simplicity 
•
 "I don't want to day trade. 30-60 minutes maximum. Put the trade on, set the stops, walk away." 

•
 "I'd rather trade 5 products I know well than 20 I don't understand." 

•
 "The best ticker is the one that's working. Don't force trades in dead products." 


On Risk 
•
 "Reduce size after losses, not increase. The biggest mistake traders make is trying to 'make it back'." 

•
 "Never risk more than 2% of your portfolio on any single trade." 

•
 "When VIX is 12, be patient or trade calendars" 


On Success 
•
 "I like to win. I want a 70-80-90% win rate." 

•
 "Slow and steady doesn't just win the race - it's the only way to finish the race at all." 

•
 "Start with what's liquid: ES for 0DTE, crude and gold for strangles." 


On Trading Philosophy 
•
 "This is a trading account, not retirement. I'm willing to take risks here." 

•
 "Diversification is protection, not speculation." 

•
 "When in doubt, stick to ES, CL, and GC. They've paid my bills for 20 years." 


MATHEMATICAL FORMULAS FOR AUTOMATION 
Position Sizing Calculations 
Kelly Criterion Modified for Options 
Position Size = (Win% × Avg Win) - (Loss% × Avg Loss) / Avg Win 
Tom's Override: Cap at 5% of account regardless of Kelly 
Buying Power Allocation 
Available BP = Account Value × VIX_Multiplier × 0.8 
Where VIX_Multiplier: 
  <13: 0.45 
  13-18: 0.65 
  18-25: 0.775 
  >25: 0.50 
  >30: 0.80 (puts only) 
Contract Sizing Formula 
Contracts = MIN( 
  Floor(Risk Amount / Max Loss per Contract), 
  Max Contracts by Strategy, 
  Correlation Limit 
) 
0DTE Strike Selection 
Call Short Strike = Current + (ATR × 0.7) 
Put Short Strike = Current - (ATR × 0.7) 
Wing Width = Always 30 points (ES) 
Strangle Strike Calculation 
Put Strike = Underlying × (1 - (IV × sqrt(DTE/365) × 0.5)) 
Call Strike = Underlying × (1 + (IV × sqrt(DTE/365) × 0.4)) 
IPMCC Weekly Call Strike 
If 8EMA > 21EMA: Strike = Current × 1.005 
If 8EMA = 21EMA: Strike = Current × 1.000 
If 8EMA < 21EMA: Strike = Current × 0.995 
Risk Metrics 
Position Health Score (0-100) 
Health = 100 - ( 
  (DTE_Risk × 20) + 
  (PnL_Risk × 30) + 
  (Correlation_Risk × 25) + 
  (BP_Risk × 25) 
) 
Where: 
•
 DTE_Risk = 1 if <21 DTE, else 0 

•
 PnL_Risk = 1 if at stop loss, else 0 

•
 Correlation_Risk = Current/Limit ratio 

•
 BP_Risk = Usage/Max ratio 


Expectancy Calculation 
Expectancy = (Win% × Avg Win) - (Loss% × Avg Loss) 
Minimum Required: £100 per trade 
Maximum Drawdown Tolerance 
Max DD = Account Value × 0.20 
If DD > 10%: Reduce new positions 50% 
If DD > 15%: Stop new trades 
If DD > 20%: Close all positions 
Correlation Calculations 
Correlation Coefficient Check 
If abs(correlation) > 0.70: Same group 
If abs(correlation) > 0.50: Monitor closely 
If abs(correlation) < 0.30: Independent 
Group Exposure Calculation 
Group Risk = Sum(Position Deltas × Underlying × Multiplier) 
Max Group Risk = Account Value × 0.15 
Profit Target Formulas 
Standard Profit Targets 
0DTE: 50% of credit received 
Strangles: 50% of credit received 
112 Naked Puts: 90% of credit received 
IPMCC Weekly: 90% of extrinsic value 
Butterflies: Hold to expiration 
Diagonals: 50% of max profit 
Time-Based Exits 
If DTE < 21 and Profit% > 25%: Close 
If DTE < 7 and Profit% > 10%: Close 
If Friday 3:00 PM: Close all 0DTE 
VIX-Adjusted Formulas 
Strangle Sizing by VIX 
Base Contracts × (Current VIX / 20) 
Capped at 2× base regardless of VIX 
Butterfly Debit by VIX 
Max Debit = Account × 0.003 × (VIX / 15) 
Never exceed £500 regardless 
Weekly Iron Condor Variations (0DTE) 
When Market is Flat (±0.5%) 
Standard Iron Condor: 
•
 Call Short: Current + (ATR × 0.5) 

•
 Put Short: Current - (ATR × 0.5) 

•
 Wings: 30 points each side 

•
 Credit Target: £400-500 


Broken Wing Iron Condor (Tom's Preference): 
•
 Wider wings on tested side 

•
 30 points untested side 

•
 50 points tested side 

•
 Reduces risk on trending days 


Batman Spread (Advanced) 
For Extreme Low Volatility (VIX <12): 
•
 Sell 2 ATM straddles 

•
 Buy 1 OTM strangle for protection 

•
 Risk graph looks like Batman symbol 

•
 Only for experienced traders

FINAL WISDOM FROM TOM KING 
"After 40 years and 6 blown accounts, here's what I know: 
The difference between traders who make it and those who don't isn't intelligence or luck - it's discipline and risk management. 
Start small, trade mechanically, take profits systematically, and never risk more than you can afford to lose. 
This system works if you work it. But it only works if you follow it exactly. No modifications, no 'improvements,' no exceptions. 
Your freedom awaits. Execute accordingly."
