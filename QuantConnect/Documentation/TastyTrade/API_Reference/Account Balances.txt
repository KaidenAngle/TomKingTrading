List Account Balances
Each account has a single account balance object. This object describes the monetary values pertaining to the account, such as cash-balance, cash-available-to-withdraw, and net-liquidating-value.

net-liquidating-value is the total current value of the account. It basically shows how much cash you would end up with if you were to close all your positions.

pending-cash is cash that is in a holding period temporarily while a cash transfer is processed. You will see a value here when the customer has initiated a cash deposit or withdrawal. For deposits, the pending-cash-effect field will be Credit, meaning the account is about to be credited.

Fields like long-equity-value and long-derivative-value describe the value of your positions, where derivative means options. The account in the example below has equity positions valued at $24629.746 and cryptocurrency positions valued at $671.991. If the account were to buy a futures contract, you would see a value in the long-futures-value field.

You can see an account's buying power via the equity-buying-power and derivative-buying-power fields.

List Account Balance Snapshots
An account balance snapshot is created twice a day: once in the morning and once after the equities market closes.

This endpoint returns a single balance snapshot object and the most current account balance object.

You can optionally provide a snapshot-date parameter to fetch a snapshot for a specific date. You must also provide a time-of-day parameter to specify whether you want the snapshot created from the start or end of the day.

If no parameters are given, the most recent balance snapshot is returned.
