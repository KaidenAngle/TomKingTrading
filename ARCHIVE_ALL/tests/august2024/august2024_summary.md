## Executive Summary

## The Disaster: What Actually Happened

On August 5, 2024, Tom King lost **£308,000 (58% of account)** in a single trading day due to:

- **0DTE position entered before 10:30 AM** during gap-down
- **No diversification** - 100% equity correlation
- **VIX spike from 23.4 to 45.2** amplifying losses

## Framework Protection Mechanisms

- **Framework Rule**: No 0DTE before 10:30 AM (gap-down protection)

### 4. Multi-Asset Diversification ✅
- **Tom's Mistake**: 100% equity correlation
- **Framework Rule**: Enforce diversification across asset classes
- **Protection**: Energy and metals positions provide **cross-hedging**

### 5. VIX-Based Position Sizing ✅
