# Master System Execution Protocol - Tom King Trading Framework

## Mission: Complete System Transformation Through Systematic Execution

Execute all Tom King Trading System protocols in optimal sequence to achieve production-ready perfection. This protocol coordinates the execution of all 8 specialized prompts in the most efficient manner possible.

## Pre-Execution Preparation

**System State Backup:**
- Create complete backup of current system state
- Document current functionality baseline
- Note any known issues or fragile components
- Establish rollback procedures

**Environment Validation:**
- Verify all methodology documentation is accessible
- Confirm all protocol files are present and readable
- Check system resources and execution environment
- Validate file permissions and access rights

## Phase 1: Initial System Assessment and Baseline

**Execute: Algorithm Analysis & Documentation (Prompt 5)**
```
Provide a comprehensive breakdown of how the algorithm works now - every step of the process from initialization to trade execution. Cross-reference this against all methodology documents to identify gaps in logic or implementation.

Analyze all features and functions we have and create an extremely detailed list. Identify any that are over-engineered and could be simplified (like FOMC/news day systems that could be binary switches). Focus on removing potential error-prone complexity.

Verify all strategies are implemented correctly based on: account balance phases, VIX thresholds, BP% utilization per strategy, ticker concentration limits, Greeks-based pattern analysis, option chain details, strike price selection, expected credit calculations, and multi-leg/multi-expiration date handling.

Document any non-linear examples or complex interdependencies you discover.
```

**Phase 1 Validation:**
- [ ] Complete algorithm flow documented
- [ ] All features and functions catalogued
- [ ] Over-engineered components identified
- [ ] Strategy implementations verified against methodology
- [ ] Baseline system understanding established

**Proceed to Phase 2 only if Phase 1 validation complete**

## Phase 2: System Organization and Cleanup

**Execute: Codebase Cleanup Protocol (Prompt 2)**
```
Execute the attached CODEBASE_CLEANUP_PROTOCOL.md completely yet tactfully, as many of the systems are quite delicate.
Clean up the Tom King Trading System codebase by systematically eliminating all redundancies, placeholders, truncations, duplicate implementations, and confusing content. Work through every phase until the codebase is pristine, focused, and waste-free.
Be aggressive in removing anything that doesn't serve a clear purpose. When in doubt, remove it - clean code is better than cluttered code.
The algorithm should be production ready after this.
```

**Execute: Code Quality & Redundancy Analysis (Prompt 6)**
```
Check for redundancies between individual strategy files and main.py. Ensure these are utilized in the most efficient and cleanest way possible, creating robust code that's difficult to accidentally break.

Extensively search through all files and folders repeatedly using subagents where possible. This should be extremely meticulous and time-consuming work - go through each file in detail, over and over, ensuring no stone is left unturned.

Always check if a task or feature has already been implemented before working on it, as there may be duplicate files and functions that need consolidating.

Rename any functions, files, or folders that could be confusing to make everything as clear and easy to understand as possible.
```

**Phase 2 Validation:**
- [ ] All redundancies eliminated
- [ ] Code organization improved
- [ ] File/folder names clarified
- [ ] Duplicate implementations consolidated
- [ ] System remains functional after cleanup

**Proceed to Phase 3 only if Phase 2 validation complete**

## Phase 3: Comprehensive System Validation

**Execute: Comprehensive Audit Protocol (Prompt 1)**
```
Execute the attached COMPREHENSIVE_AUDIT_PROTOCOL.md completely and autonomously. 
Work through every phase systematically, fixing all issues as you discover them, until the system achieves production-ready perfection.
Begin immediately with the systematic file inspection and continue through all phases until no new issues are found in a complete system review.
The algorithm should be production ready after this.
```

**Execute: Unified Audit Protocol (Prompt 3)**
```
Execute the UNIFIED_AUDIT_PROTOCOL.md autonomously and comprehensively.
Research the Tom King methodology through the available documentation, analyze the current system implementation, and systematically address all gaps and issues you discover through your analysis.
Work completely independently until the system achieves your determined standards for production readiness.
The algorithm should be production ready after this.
```

**Phase 3 Validation:**
- [ ] All methodology compliance verified
- [ ] Implementation gaps identified and fixed
- [ ] System integration validated
- [ ] Risk management systems verified
- [ ] All strategies properly implemented

**Proceed to Phase 4 only if Phase 3 validation complete**

## Phase 4: Advanced Error Detection and Logic Validation

**Execute: Deep Logic Analysis Protocol (Prompt 4)**
```
Execute the attached DEEP_LOGIC_ANALYSIS_PROTOCOL.md with maximum thoroughness, creativity, and adversarial thinking.
This is a comprehensive investigation to uncover hard-to-spot logic inversions, methodology violations, and subtle implementation errors that could cause catastrophic system failures or financial losses. Go beyond surface-level checking - dig deep into behavioral assumptions, economic theory, temporal effects, and emergent system properties.
Be aggressively skeptical and trust your analytical instincts. If something feels wrong, investigate it. Think like someone trying to break the system, an experienced trader reviewing for real money deployment, and a forensic analyst investigating after a major failure.
Look for the types of subtle but critical errors that would pass code review but cause the system to behave opposite to intended design under real market conditions.
Report all findings with specific evidence, impact analysis, and confidence levels. Focus particularly on issues that could cause significant financial losses or fundamental strategy misbehavior.
```

**Execute: Integration & Gap Analysis (Prompt 7)**
```
Review all integrations from this conversation and identify anything we may have missed or should double-check. Many systems are delicate and complex, so avoid accidentally breaking anything.

Add any additional tasks for functionality that may have been overlooked. Utilize the methodology documentation extensively to understand exactly what should be covered and included in our program and systems. Be aware of potential redundancies.
```

**Phase 4 Validation:**
- [ ] All logic inversions identified and corrected
- [ ] Critical implementation errors fixed
- [ ] Integration gaps addressed
- [ ] System behavior verified against methodology
- [ ] Edge cases and failure scenarios tested

**Proceed to Phase 5 only if Phase 4 validation complete**

## Phase 5: Autonomous Testing Framework and Continuous Validation

**Execute: Autonomous Testing Framework (Prompt 8)**
```
Write yourself a detailed prompt that ensures you thoroughly test, flesh out, and develop everything. Keep autonomously iterating for as long as possible with as many tasks under one execution as possible to avoid forced input interruptions.

Your self-created prompt should include:
1. What needs constant checking based on issues seen in this codebase
2. Verification steps to run after every change  
3. The gotchas - things that keep breaking or getting forgotten
4. Success criteria for true completion
5. Stress tests and edge cases that tend to break things

Follow your own prompt immediately to maximize autonomous work without input.
```

**Phase 5 Validation:**
- [ ] Autonomous testing framework created and functional
- [ ] Continuous validation procedures established
- [ ] All stress tests passing
- [ ] System demonstrating stable autonomous operation
- [ ] Success criteria met for all components
