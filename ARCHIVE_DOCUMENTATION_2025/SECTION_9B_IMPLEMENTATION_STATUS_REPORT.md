## RISK ASSESSMENT FOR CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION

### STRENGTHS

1. **Robust Foundation:** Core Greeks and risk management systems are professional-grade
2. **August 2024 Protection:** Correlation limits prevent disaster scenarios
3. **VIX Integration:** Sophisticated volatility regime awareness
4. **Phase Progression:** Proper account size restrictions and strategy qualification
5. **Tested Implementation:** All current strategies pass comprehensive testing

### RISKS

1. **Manual Management Dependency:** 21 DTE and adjustment protocols require manual oversight
2. **Incomplete Strategy Suite:** Missing advanced strategies limit Phase 4+ optimization
3. **Real-Time Limitations:** Greeks monitoring requires periodic manual checks
