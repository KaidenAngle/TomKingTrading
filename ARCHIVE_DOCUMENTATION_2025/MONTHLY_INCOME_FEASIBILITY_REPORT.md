## Technical Implementation Details

### Core System Architecture

```javascript
// Monthly Income Calculation Flow
MonthlyIncomeCalculator.calculateMonthlyIncomeRequirements(accountValue, targetMonthly, vixLevel)
├── determine account phase
├── calculate VIX adjustment multiplier  
├── calculate0DTERequirements(40% allocation)
├── calculateLT112Requirements(35% allocation)
├── calculateStrangleRequirements(25% allocation)
├── calculateFeasibilityScore()
└── generateRecommendations()

// Theta Optimization Integration
ThetaOptimizationEngine.optimizePortfolioTheta(accountValue, positions, vixLevel)
├── analyzeCurrentThetaPositions()
├── calculateThetaGaps()
├── generateOptimizationRecommendations()
└── projectMonthlyThetaIncome()
```

### Mathematical Framework Validation

#### **Expected Value Calculations**
- **0DTE:** E[Profit] = (Credit × 0.88) - (Loss × 0.12) ✅
- **LT112:** E[Profit] = (Credit × 0.73) - (Loss × 0.27) ✅  
- **Strangles:** E[Profit] = (Credit × 0.72) - (Loss × 0.28) ✅

#### **Position Sizing Logic**
```javascript
// Contracts needed calculation
contractsNeeded = targetIncome / (expectedProfitPerContract × tradesPerMonth)
adjustedContracts = contractsNeeded × vixMultiplier
```

#### **Buying Power Management**
```javascript
// BP safety enforcement
maxBPPerStrategy = accountValue × strategyLimit × safetyMargin
bpRequired = adjustedContracts × bpPerContract
compliance = bpRequired <= maxBPPerStrategy
```
